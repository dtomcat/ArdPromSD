# ArduinoProm
[![Build](https://github.com/dtomcat/ArdPromSD/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dtomcat/ArdPromSD/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This project is based on the work from Ryzee119's ArduinoProm:

>ArduinoProm. An Arduino based Original Xbox EEPROM reader and writer.
>It can be used to recover a HDD key etc. <br><br>
>ArduinoProm is inspired and adapted upon the awesome work by Grimdoomer on PiPROM, now achievable on a <$3 Arduino board.
>See https://github.com/grimdoomer/PiPROM for the Original Raspberry Pi version!
>  
>**Use at your own risk**
>

>The firmware has been written around the Arduino Pro Micro Leonardo (5V/16Mhz). However I would expect it to work on any Arduino with a built in USB >bootloader/Virtual Comport support, and obviously I2C support.
>1. Open `ArduinoProm.ino` in [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)
>2. Connect your Arduino to your PC and setup the IDE. An example below <br> ![Arduino IDE preview](https://i.imgur.com/V7CJpkd.png)
>3. Hit the program button then confirm it compiles and programs successfully.
